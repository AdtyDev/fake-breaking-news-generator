# fake-breaking-news-generator

A fun and lighthearted Python program that randomly generates absurd and humorous news headlines by combining a subject, an action, and a location.

## ðŸ¤– How It Works

Each time you run the program, it prints a **random fake headline** like:

> BREAKING NEWS: Modi dances with at red fort

You can keep generating more headlines until you type `"no"` to stop.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Randomly generates funny news headlines
- Uses three different lists: subject, action, and location
- Simple and interactive terminal experience
- Teaches random selection, string formatting, and loops

## ðŸ§  Python Concepts Demonstrated
